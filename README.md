> The official Esri Leaflet documentation has moved to [developers.arcgis.com/esri-leaflet](https://developers.arcgis.com/esri-leaflet/), and this repository is archived. If you have any suggestions or contributions for the documentation going forward, please [log an issue in the Esri Leaflet repository](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/issues/new/choose) (select "Documentation").

# Esri Leaflet Documentation Site

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository.
2. `npm install -g grunt-cli`
3. `npm install`
4. Create a new file, `data/secret.json` to include an API Key:
   ```
   {
     "api_key": "YOUR API KEY HERE"
   }
   ```
4. `npm start`

In order to update the version of Leaflet, Esri Leaflet or any other plugin displayed in the documentation site:

1. Find and update the appropriate library version listed in `package.json` [devDependency](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet-doc/blob/master/package.json).
2. Rerun `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run integrity` (to generate a corresponding [Subresource Integrity](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-subresource-integrity/) hash).
4. Run `npm start` to confirm locally that this achieved the desired effect.
5. Send a Pull Request!

### Development Tips

#### Testing/Linting

Before committing, run `npm test`, which will run [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) (enforcing the [Semistandard style](https://github.com/standard/semistandard)) on all our sample code to ensure the samples are consistently formatted.

File changes will be watched and also linted with ESLint if you have run `npm start` prior to editing the samples.

#### VS Code

If you're using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [ESLint Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint), you can create a new file at `.vscode/settings.json` with the following contents to enable live linting on the HBS files:

```json
{
  "eslint.validate": [
    "javascript",
    "javascriptreact",
    "handlebars"
  ]
}
```

#### Local Esri-Leaflet

If you're working on changes to esri-leaflet locally and want to see those changes within the context of the documentation site:

1. Run `npm start` in the `esri-leaflet` project. This will host the built esri-leaflet file at `http://localhost:5000/dist/esri-leaflet-debug.js` or similar.
1. In this repository, in `\data\devSiteData.json`, set the `localSource` property to `true` and set the `localSourceUrl` property to the full url of your `esri-leaflet-debug.js` file if it's not the same as above.
1. Run `npm start` in this project, and the documentation site will be hosted but load the `esri-leaflet` library locally instead of the CDN version.
