# {{page.data.title}}

`L.esri.Geocoding.Geosearch` is a control for auto-complete enabled search.  You can find more information and the source code for this plugin [here](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet-geocoder).

### Constructor
Extends [`L.Control`](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#control)

            <th>Constructor</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>

        </tr>

</table>

### Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `position` | `String` | `'topleft'` | Expects a valid Leaflet [control position](http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#control-positions).|
| `zoomToResult` | `Boolean` | `true` | Determines whether or not the map will zoom to the result after geocoding is complete. |
| `useMapBounds` | `Boolean` or `Integer` | `12` | Determines if and when the geocoder should use the bounds of the map to filter search results. If `true` the geocoder will always return results in the current map bounds. If `false` it will always search the world. If an integer (like `11`) is passed, the geocoder will use the bounds of the map for searching only if the map is currently zoomed in far enough. |
| `collapseAfterResult` | `Boolean` | `true` | Determines whether or not the geocoder should collapse after a result is found. |
| `expanded` | `Boolean` | `false` | Determines whether or not the geocoder starts in an expanded state. |
| `allowMultipleResults` | `Boolean` | `true` | If set to `true` and the user submits the form without a suggestion, the control will geocode the current text in the input. |
| `providers` | `Array` | See description | An array of [providers](#Providers) to search. |
| `placeholder` | `String` | 'Search for places or addresses' | Placeholder text for the search input. |
| `title` | `String` | 'Location Search' | Title text for the search input. Shows as a tooltip on hover. |
| `searchBounds` | `L.latLngBounds` | `null` | If set, the geocoder will filter results using the provided static bounding box regardless of the current zoom level of the map, overriding `useMapBounds` entirely.

### Events

| Event | Data | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| results | [`<ResultsEvent>`](#Results) | Fired when results are returned from the geocoder. |

Events from each provider will match the events fired by [`L.esri.Service`](../services/service.html).

### Methods

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Method</th>
            <th>Returns</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><code>clear()</code></td>
            <td><code>this</code></td>
            <td>Clears the current text and collapses the control if `collapseAfterResult` is true.
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><code>disable()</code></td>
            <td></td>
            <td>grays out the input so that addresses cannot be searched.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>enable()</code></td>
            <td></td>
            <td>ungray the input so that addresses can once again be searched.
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

### Styling

For reference here is the internal DOM structure of the geocoder

```xml
<div class="geocoder-control leaflet-control">
  <input class="geocoder-control-input leaflet-bar">
  <ul class="geocoder-control-suggestions leaflet-bar">
    <li class="geocoder-control-suggestion geocoder-control-selected">The Selected Result</li>
    <li class="geocoder-control-suggestion">Another Result</li>
  </ul>
</div>
```
### Providers

The `Geosearch` control can also search for results from a variety of sources including Feature Layers and Map Services. This is done with plain text matching and is not "real" geocoding. But it allows you to mix custom results into a search box.

```xml
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./esri-leaflet-geocoder.css">
<script src="./esri-leaflet-geocoder.js"></script>
```

```js
var arcgisOnline = L.esri.Geocoding.arcgisOnlineProvider();
var gisDay = L.esri.Geocoding.featureLayerProvider({
  url: 'https://services.arcgis.com/uCXeTVveQzP4IIcx/arcgis/rest/services/GIS_Day_Final/FeatureServer/0',
  searchFields: ['Name', 'Organization'], // Search these fields for text matches
  label: 'GIS Day Events', // Group suggestions under this header
  formatSuggestion: function(feature){
    return feature.properties.Name + ' - ' + feature.properties.Organization; // format suggestions like this.
  }
});

L.esri.Geocoding.Controls.geosearch({
  providers: [arcgisOnline, gisDay] // will geocode via ArcGIS Online and search the GIS Day feature service.
}).addTo(map);
```
#### Available Providers
* `L.esri.Geocoding.arcgisOnlineProvider`<br>uses the ArcGIS Online World Geocoding service.

* `L.esri.Geocoding.featureLayerProvider`<br>gets results by querying a Feature Layer for text matches.

* `L.esri.Geocoding.mapServiceProvider`<br>uses the find and query methods of ArcGIS Server Map Services to get text matches.

* `L.esri.Geocoding.geocodeServiceProvider`<br>uses an ArcGIS Server Geocode Service (and supports suggestions from ArcGIS Server 10.3+ enabled endpoints).

All providers share the following options:
