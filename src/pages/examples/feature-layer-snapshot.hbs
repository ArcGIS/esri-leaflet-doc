title: Load each and every feature initially
description: Sometimes it is desirable to load a "snapshot" of a Feature Layer instead of loading it progressively as you pan around the map. The approach is useful for smaller services.

<div id="map"></div>

<script>
  var map = L.map("map").setView([45.5252, -122.6284], 11);

  L.esri.basemapLayer("Topographic").addTo(map);

  var neighborhoodsUrl = "https://services.arcgis.com/rOo16HdIMeOBI4Mb/arcgis/rest/services/Neighborhoods_pdx/FeatureServer/0";
  var bikeParkingUrl = "https://services.arcgis.com/rOo16HdIMeOBI4Mb/arcgis/rest/services/Portland_Bicycle_Parking/FeatureServer/0";

  // query a feature service for a neighborhood
  L.esri.query({
    url: neighborhoodsUrl
  }).where("NAME='HOLLYWOOD'").run(function(error, neighborhoods){
    // draw neighborhood on the map
    var hollywood = L.geoJSON(neighborhoods).addTo(map);

    // fit map to boundry
    map.fitBounds(hollywood.getBounds().pad(0.5));

    // query all bike parking where BPSTYLE='STAPLE' inside our boundary
    L.esri.query({
      url: bikeParkingUrl
    }).where("BPSTYLE='STAPLE'").within(hollywood).run(function(error, bikeParking){
      L.geoJSON(bikeParking).addTo(map);
    });
  });
