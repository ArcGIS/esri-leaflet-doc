title: ImageMapLayer MosaicRule
description: Display an Image Service from ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Server and apply a mosaic rule to dynamically control how the service combines rasters into a mosaic. This sample shows sea temperature at the surface for the week of April 7, 2014. More information about Image Services can be found in the <a href="/esri-leaflet/api-reference/layers/image-map-layer.html">L.esri.ImageMapLayer</a> documentation.
